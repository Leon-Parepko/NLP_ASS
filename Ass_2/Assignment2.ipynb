    "## Implement context-sensitive spelling correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement context-sensitive spelling corrector using N-gram language model. The idea is to compute conditional probabilities of possible correction options. For example, the phrase \"dking sport\" should be fixed as \"doing sport\" not \"dying sport\", while \"dking species\" -- as \"dying species\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to start is to analyze [Norvig's solution](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) and [N-gram Language Models](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to implement:\n",
    "- spell-checking for a concrete language - Russian, Tatar, etc. - any one you know, such that the solution accounts for language specifics,\n",
    "- some recent (or not very recent) paper on this topic,\n",
    "- solution which takes into account keyboard layout and associated misspellings,\n",
    "- efficiency improvement to make the solution faster,\n",
    "- any other idea of yours to improve the Norvig’s solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT:  \n",
    "Your project should not be a mere code copy-paste from somewhere. You must provide:\n",
    "- Your implementation\n",
    "- Analysis of why the implemented approach is suggested\n",
    "- Improvements of the original approach that you have chosen to implement"

The n-gram model, on the other hand, is a good model to predict the next word given the previous one. So the idea is to combine these two models to increase the accuracy of the spellchecker.\n",

    "To simplify the algorithm, the Norvig's solution is used to detect words need to be corrected. So if the one did not offer the candidates at all or offer single one similar to check word, then the word treated as 'incorrect'. The approach is used because the methodology of the one is approved and well-known. Moreover, in case we want to improve the accuracy of Norvig's solution, such tagging ('correct', 'incorrect') is obligatory for the n-gram to further deal only with context dependent cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used for the training part is a hybrid of two datasets. The first one is a big.txt file from Norvig's solution. I have chosen this dataset because it is a very good balanced corpus of English text. During the experiments with much bigger datasets ([wikipedia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jkkphys/english-wikipedia-articles-20170820-sqlite), [english books](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raynardj/classic-english-literature-corpus), etc.) it was found that the word dictionary seems to be hard to filter and containing a lot of words with 'spell' mistakes.\n",

Fivegrams and trigrams results in a high number of variations but with low possibility of being fitted to the context. In such cases, the n-gram model simply did not give any predictions, since that bigrams are used.\n",

    "Another important thing is the probability aggregation. In my model, the N-gram and Norvig's solutions are equally weighted. So to get the final prediction, the probabilities of the two models are normalized and averaged if both predicts the same word with different probability.
